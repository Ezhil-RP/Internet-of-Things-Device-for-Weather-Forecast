# Internet-of-Things-Device-for-Weather-Forecast
An intelligent IOT prototype is designed using BeagleBone Black ARM and Xinu, an OS for Embedded Systems. The system has been designed to be effectively scalable with a composite nature accommodating both analog and digital temperature sensors and actuators. Low-level drivers were implemented to interface sensors to Xinu and high-level driver is implemented using a standalone java application for parsing DDL JSON. UDP was used for client-server interactions. Edge device is a PC running a Python UDP server/client. Nodejs is used as the driver for the MONGO DB connection hosted on mLab.com using Database-as-a-Service. A hybrid application with speech recognition and text to speech capabilities (using Apache Cordova plugin) developed on Ionic Framework for Android users which uses AngularJs for all the heavy-lifting like making REST calls to the Nodejs application hosted on Heroku. This app notifies the user about the current temperature and provides appropriate suggestions to the user for the current temperature.
